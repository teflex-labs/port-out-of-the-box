# Port resource promotion (Terraform)

Promote your Port configuration through environments the same way you ship code: review a plan on a pull request, apply to Integration on merge, and roll out to Staging then Production on release.

One committed Terraform root — `terraform/`, especially `generated.tf` — is the single source of truth. Every step plans and applies that same module, so what you review is exactly what gets promoted. There is no live export step in CI.

This implementation is built on the [Port Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/port-labs/port-labs/latest/docs), Terraform Cloud (state + workspace), and GitHub Actions.

## How it flows

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    PR["Pull request"] -->|plan + PR comment| INT_preview["Integration state"]
    Main["Push to main"] -->|plan + apply| INT["Integration"]
    Release["Publish release"] -->|plan + apply + test| STG["Staging"]
    STG -->|approval required| PRD["Production"]
```

| When you... | The pipeline... | Target |
|---|---|---|
| Open a pull request | Plans the PR module against Integration state and posts the plan as a PR comment (no apply) | Integration |
| Merge to `main` | Plans, then applies the saved plan | Integration |
| Publish a release | Plans, applies, and runs a convergence test | Staging |
| ...after Staging passes | Plans and applies in one job, gated by a required reviewer | Production |

Integration and the release flow are independent — promoting to Staging/Production never reads Integration's live state. Each job checks out the repo at the ref that triggered it, so a release always promotes the config exactly as it was tagged.

## What's in the box

This directory contains:

- [`.github/workflows/port-promote-terraform.yml`](.github/workflows/port-promote-terraform.yml) — the promotion pipeline.
- `.github/actions/terraform-setup` — validates credentials, ensures a local-execution TFC workspace, init/validate.
- `.github/actions/terraform-plan` — plans and writes summaries (optional convergence mode).
- `.github/actions/terraform-apply` — applies a saved plan and writes summaries.
- [`terraform/`](terraform/) — Port provider module; commit your `generated.tf` here after bootstrap.

## Prerequisites

- A Port account with [client credentials](https://docs.port.io/build-your-software-catalog/custom-integration/api/#get-api-token) for each target org (Integration, Staging, Production)
- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install) >= 1.15.0 installed locally (to bootstrap state)
- A Terraform Cloud organization where you can create one workspace and one team API token per environment
- [`terraform-import-generator`](https://github.com/port-experimental/terraform-import-generator) for the one-time bootstrap of `generated.tf`
- Admin access on the repo so you can create GitHub Environments

## Use it in your repo

Enabling this project inside a fork of this catalog instead? Copy only `.github/` to the repository root, leave `terraform/` where it is, and see the [repo README](../../../README.md) for that flow.

1. **Copy** the contents of this directory into your repo (the `.github/` folder and `terraform/`).
2. **Create the GitHub Environments the pipeline uses:** `integration`, `staging`, `production` (`sandbox` is reserved and not wired yet).
   Environment names are just deployment stages — rename them to whatever convention your org uses. The Port org each stage targets is determined by its credentials (`PORT_CLIENT_ID` / `PORT_CLIENT_SECRET`), not the environment name.
3. **Add protections:**
   - `integration` — no branch restriction (`plan-int` must run on `pull_request`). Optionally add required reviewers (see [PR-credential model](#pr-credential-model-and-accepted-risk)).
   - `staging` — restrict to release tags (e.g. `v*`).
   - `production` — required reviewers + release tags.
4. **In Terraform Cloud**, create one team + team API token per environment, each granted access to **only** that environment's workspace (`port-config-integration`, `port-config-staging`, `port-config-production` when using the default slug). Use each as that environment's `TF_API_TOKEN`.
5. **Configure each of `integration`, `staging`, and `production`** with:
   - Secrets: `PORT_CLIENT_SECRET`, `TF_API_TOKEN`
   - Variables: `PORT_CLIENT_ID`, `TFC_ORGANIZATION`
   - Optional: `PORT_BASE_URL` (defaults to `https://api.us.port.io`; set `https://api.port.io` for EU)
6. **Generate and commit** `terraform/generated.tf`, then bootstrap Integration state. See [`terraform/README.md`](terraform/README.md).

That's it. Push to `main` promotes to Integration — you should see a plan run and an apply run for Integration under the Actions tab. Publishing a release promotes through Staging to Production.

## Auth and targeting

| Source | Variable / Secret | Used as |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub Environment | `PORT_CLIENT_ID`, `PORT_CLIENT_SECRET` | Port provider OAuth (`PORT_CLIENT_*` env) |
| GitHub Environment | `PORT_BASE_URL` (optional) | Port provider `base_url` (defaults to `https://api.us.port.io`; set `https://api.port.io` for EU) |
| GitHub Environment | `TF_API_TOKEN` | Terraform Cloud API + CLI credentials |
| GitHub Environment | `TFC_ORGANIZATION` | `TF_CLOUD_ORGANIZATION` |
| Workflow env | `TFC_WORKSPACE_SLUG` (`port-config`) | Base for `TF_WORKSPACE=${SLUG}-${environment}` |
| Workflow env | `TFC_WORKSPACE_TAGS` (`port-config`) | Tags applied when ensuring the TFC workspace |

Workflow env also sets `PORT_BETA_FEATURES_ENABLED=true` so generated page/folder resources can plan and apply. Workspaces use `execution_mode=local` so plan/apply run on the GitHub Actions runner while state lives in TFC.

## PR-credential model and accepted risk

Unlike [`port-promote-port-cli`](../port-cli/) — whose committed JSON export lets a PR preview run as a credential-free file-vs-file diff — a real `terraform plan` must read live state (`TF_API_TOKEN`) and refresh through the Port provider (`PORT_CLIENT_*`). A credential-free live plan is therefore impossible.

As a result, `plan-int` runs on `pull_request` with the `integration` environment's secrets in scope, and that code is checked out from the PR ref (including `.github/actions/terraform-*/**`). This is an accepted risk, bounded by:

- **Forks excluded.** The `head.repo.full_name == github.repository` guard skips fork PRs, and GitHub withholds environment secrets from forks regardless.
- **Push access required.** Only collaborators who can open a same-repo branch PR can trigger it.
- **Workspace-scoped tokens.** With per-environment `TF_API_TOKEN`s, the worst case is exposure of the lowest environment's credentials, which cannot escalate to `staging`/`production`.
- **Optional gate.** Add required reviewers to the `integration` environment so a human approves before PR-authored code runs with secrets.

## CI plan timing and Port access-token TTL

CI plan/apply use `-parallelism=2`. GitHub-hosted runner egress is rate-limited more aggressively by Port than a local machine; default Terraform parallelism (10) can stall refreshes and fail mid-plan. Local runs can keep the default parallelism.

The Port Terraform provider authenticates **once** at configure time and **does not refresh** when the token expires. Port access tokens are short-lived; check the current TTL with:

```bash
curl -s -X POST "${PORT_BASE_URL}/v1/auth/access_token" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"clientId\":\"${PORT_CLIENT_ID}\",\"clientSecret\":\"${PORT_CLIENT_SECRET}\"}" \
  | jq '{expiresIn, tokenType, accessTokenLen: (.accessToken | length)}'
```

Treat `expiresIn` as a hard ceiling for GHA-hosted full refreshes until the provider re-auths on expiry.

## Make it yours

- **Add your own tests.** The `test-stg` job has an extension point — drop in API reachability checks, blueprint/action assertions, or any validation you need before Production is eligible.
- **Tune the workspace slug.** Change `TFC_WORKSPACE_SLUG` / `TFC_WORKSPACE_TAGS` in the workflow `env:` block if you want different TFC naming.
- **Tune the layout.** Two settings must agree on where the Terraform root module lives: the `TF_WORKING_DIRECTORY` default (overridable with a `TF_WORKING_DIRECTORY` repository variable) and the `on.push` / `on.pull_request` path filters. The workflow ships pointed at this catalog's nested layout, so it runs as-is from a fork. When this directory becomes your repository root, set `TF_WORKING_DIRECTORY` to `terraform` and the path filters to `terraform/**`.
- **Adjust the gates.** Environment protections are standard GitHub settings — tighten reviewers, branch/tag rules, or wait timers to match your org's release process.
